Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Instructions

    - [Design](#design)
  - [React](#react)
  - [Updated LinkedIn Profile](#updated-linkedin-profile)

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * GIF or screenshot of the deployed application
  
  
  my current react portfolio is missing a few things, but they can be found on my prior portfolio linked in projects untill I can fully update everything here.
